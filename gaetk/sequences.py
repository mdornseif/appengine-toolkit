"""Google App Engine sequential number generator.

Generates sequences of numbers from a database of sequences, invaliding
sequences as they are allocated. The implementation guarantees there will be
no gap in the numbers returned if the requested amount of numbers fits into the
current sequence.

Integrity/consistency is carried out by a transaction. Due to App Engines
architecture, and the fact that only one sequence is allocated from at a time,
all allocations of numbers from the database will synchronise on the same
resource and the performance will be low - around 5-10 queries per second.

Example::

    init_sequence('test', start=1000, end=1003)
    init_sequence('other', start=1005, end=1010)
    init_sequence('test', start=10100, end=10250)
    get_numbers('test', 5)
    [1000, 1001, 1002, 10100, 10101]

"""

# Performance could be achieved by a smart sharing setup. Rather than allocating
# from a single Sequence at a time, there could be several shards which have
# pre-allocated some amount of the Sequence (e.g. 100 of the sequence), and these
# could be allocated from on an e.g. random basis, performing a sort of load
# balancing of the transactions. This wouldn't necessarily guarantee a lack of
# gaps, but as long as enough small queries are received (e.g. for 1 numbers)
# over time the gaps will be filled.
#
# To ensure correct allocation from one sequence to the next, sequences must be
# in the same entity group. Practically, this means all sequences need to have
# "parent" set. init_sequence() ensures this.
#
# See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3985812 for a general discussion of the
# problem space.
